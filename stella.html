    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>  You have until <strong><u>12:00 PM Pacific Time on
    July 15, 2013</u></strong> to <a href="https://goo.gl/zijsh">export your Google
    Reader data using Google Takeout</a>.  At that point, Google will permanently
    delete all user data related to Google Reader.&nbsp;
    (<a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-final-farewell.html">Source</a>)
   </p>
   <p>
    So if you haven&#8217;t heard already,
    <a href='http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html'>
    Google Reader <del>is shutting down</del> was shut down <del>on</del> after July 1,
    2013</a>.  However, until 12 PM Pacific Time on July 15, you can
    <a href='https://goo.gl/zijsh'>take your data out using Google Takeout</a> and
    you&#8217;ll have all your subscriptions and starred, liked, and shared articles. 
    The problem is that the article lists are JSON files with a custom schema that
    there aren&#8217;t (as far as I know) any user-friendly parsers for, so I made one.
   </p> 
   <p>
    <a href='http://stella.s.zeid.me/'>Stella</a> (you're looking at it right now!)
    runs entirely in your modern, standards-compliant,
    <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/FileReader'>HTML5 FileReader
    API</a>-supporting Web browser (you are using
    <a href='https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/'>one</a>, right?) and lets you
    view any Google Reader article list in JSON format, including your starred, liked,
    shared, and notes lists, as well as any subscriptions you&#8217;ve exported in JSON
    format (<a href="http://s.zeid.me/blog/2013/03/18/fun-with-google-reader-json-files/#exporting-feeds-as-json-files">more
    on that here</a>).  All you have to do is click &#8220;Select JSON file&#8221;,
    select your file, and start reading!  You can also save a static HTML page which
    you can view offline.
   </p>
   <p>
    It&#8217;s worth noting that Google Reader JSON files <em>do</em> contain the
    full contents of each article, and Stella does let you view those.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>Your JSON files stay on your computer.  No data is sent to my server.</strong> 
    (I promise.  I can't afford the load!)
